# BIO-350

starting our bio350 assignments repo.

IC assignment 1: chapter 1
 - making a difference equations
 - technical difficulties
 - it works
  
IC Assignment 2: chapter 2
 - exponential equation
 - technically difficulties 
 -  i think it works

 IC_inClass 1: log and conditional statments
 used code from IC Assign. 2
 plotted graph from standard to log format
 made conditional if statements 
 let copiolot do code for us
 switched numbers to manipulate graph

IC In class 3 
log function with carrying cpacity
had to include die off of organisms
made a growth model/graph for the function
strugled with this
chatgpt helped with trouble shooting

IC_inClass2
installed panda 
imported population data csv file
used copilot to create a graph of the first ten rows of data
made the graph look cleaner using copilot 
added a line to show carrying capacity and the average of the data

IC in class 4 
explored interspecific conflict 
trying to find final populations
graphed populations taking into consideraton carrying capacity die offf and competition.
saw a completely die off of one species

IC in class 3
started with data from assignment 4
looked into conditional if statments
saw how adjusting variables such as growth rate effected population

IC in class 5 
SIR model for rabies in foxs
saw how population changed in time
looked into infection rates and how diseases spread

IC_inClass Assignment 4 (Carcass)
Downloaded data from Dr. Carter as an R file.
Trasnlated to python using copilot
Ended up with three graphs
Could not figure it out was trying to go section by section
Dr Denny came over and fixed it by translating the entire code to python, in one block. Using copilot.

IC assign 7 
 made model of tree population over 100 years
 each tree is replaced by sapling underneath
 create and plot transition matrix
 count each of the three tree types
 looked at metapopulations of butterflys 
 calculate populations over 50 years
 created a 4x4 matrix using code from first part. 
 calculate chance of extinction
 plotted and graphed the model

 Biological Analysis
    Examines biological data (like DNA sequences or ecological samples) to uncover patterns and relationships.
    Involves preprocessing, statistical testing, and visualization to interpret complex biological information.
    Aims to convert raw biological data into meaningful insights about organisms or ecosystems.
Amplicon Sequencing vs. Whole Genome Sequencing
    Amplicon sequencing targets specific DNA regions (e.g., 16S rRNA) to identify organisms within a sample.
    Whole genome sequencing (WGS) sequences the entire genome, offering detailed genetic information.
    Amplicon is cost-effective for community profiling, while WGS provides comprehensive genomic data.
DNA Barcoding
    Uses short, standardized DNA sequences (‚Äúbarcodes‚Äù) to identify species.
    Enables accurate identification even from small or degraded samples.
    Commonly used in ecology, taxonomy, and biodiversity studies.
Diversity Metrics ‚Äì Alpha vs. Beta Diversity
    Alpha diversity measures species richness and evenness within a single sample.
    Beta diversity compares differences in species composition between samples.
    Together, they describe biodiversity across local and regional scales.
Extrapolation / Normalizing Data
    Extrapolation predicts values beyond observed data based on trends.
    Normalization adjusts data to a common scale to ensure fair comparisons.
    Both help reduce bias and improve the reliability of analyses and models.
When Is That Done / Necessary?
    Used when datasets are uneven, incomplete, or collected under different conditions.
    Normalization ensures fair comparisons, such as equal sequencing depth across samples.
    Extrapolation helps predict results for unmeasured conditions or estimate asymptotic diversity.
Lag Analysis
    Examines time delays between causes and their effects.
    Helps identify how long biological or environmental responses take to occur.
    Useful for understanding cause-and-effect relationships and predicting future trends.
Generalized Mixed Effect Model (GLMM)
    Extends linear mixed models to handle non-normal data (e.g., counts, binary outcomes).
    Combines fixed effects (main factors) and random effects (group-level variation).
    Suitable for hierarchical or repeated-measures biological data.
Linear Mixed Effect Model (LMM)
    Models continuous outcomes with both fixed and random effects.
    Handles correlated or grouped data, such as repeated measures on the same subject.
    Improves accuracy and accounts for non-independence in experimental data.
Allometric Scale Model
    Describes how biological traits (e.g., metabolism, growth) scale with body size.
    Often follows a power-law relationship: 
    ùëå=ùëéùëãùëè
    Y=aXb
    Helps explain how size influences biological function and ecology.
Linear vs. Logistic Regression
    Linear regression models continuous outcomes assuming a straight-line relationship.
    Logistic regression models categorical or binary outcomes (e.g., presence/absence).
    Both are foundational tools for exploring relationships in biological data.
Non-linear Regression
    Fits data to models that aren‚Äôt straight lines (e.g., exponential, sigmoidal, or logarithmic).
    Used when relationships change rate or level off over time.
    Common in biological processes like enzyme kinetics or population growth.
Random Forests
    An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees for prediction.
    Each tree votes or averages its output to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
    Handles complex, non-linear data and identifies key predictor variables.
Cross-Validation and Accuracy of Models
    Splits data into training and testing sets repeatedly to test model performance.
    Helps detect overfitting and assess how well the model generalizes to new data.
    Accuracy and related metrics measure how close predictions are to actual outcomes.
