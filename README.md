# BIO-350

starting our bio350 assignments repo.

IC assignment 1: chapter 1
 - making a difference equations
 - technical difficulties
 - it works
  
IC Assignment 2: chapter 2
 - exponential equation
 - technically difficulties 
 -  i think it works

 IC_inClass 1: log and conditional statments
 used code from IC Assign. 2
 plotted graph from standard to log format
 made conditional if statements 
 let copiolot do code for us
 switched numbers to manipulate graph

IC In class 3 
log function with carrying cpacity
had to include die off of organisms
made a growth model/graph for the function
strugled with this
chatgpt helped with trouble shooting

IC_inClass2
installed panda 
imported population data csv file
used copilot to create a graph of the first ten rows of data
made the graph look cleaner using copilot 
added a line to show carrying capacity and the average of the data

IC in class 4 
explored interspecific conflict 
trying to find final populations
graphed populations taking into consideraton carrying capacity die offf and competition.
saw a completely die off of one species

IC in class 3
started with data from assignment 4
looked into conditional if statments
saw how adjusting variables such as growth rate effected population

IC in class 5 
SIR model for rabies in foxs
saw how population changed in time
looked into infection rates and how diseases spread
